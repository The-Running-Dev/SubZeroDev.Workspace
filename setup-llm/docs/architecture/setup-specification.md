# Setup Scripts Specification

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-22  
**Status:** Active  

## 1. Overview

This specification defines the requirements and workflow for initializing a new AI-assisted project using the setup scripts in this directory. It covers workstation tool installation and project structure creation.

## 2. Setup Process Phases

### Phase 1: One-Time Workstation Setup
**Trigger:** Fresh development workstation or first-time setup  
**Frequency:** Once per workstation  
**Responsibility:** `setup.ps1`

### Phase 2: New Project Creation
**Trigger:** Starting a new project  
**Frequency:** Per project  
**Responsibility:** Manual (PowerShell commands + user)

### Phase 3: Project Initialization
**Trigger:** First time opening a project with Claude Code, Codex, or Claude Desktop  
**Frequency:** Per project  
**Responsibility:** Manual (user via CLI or IDE)

---

## 3. Phase 1: Workstation Setup (`setup.ps1`)

### 3.1 Prerequisites

Before running the setup script, verify:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or an Ubuntu/Debian-derived Linux distribution
- **PowerShell:** Windows PowerShell 5.1+ on Windows, or PowerShell 7+ on any supported OS
- **Package manager:** Winget (Windows), Homebrew (macOS), or apt/pipx (Ubuntu/Debian)
- **Docker:** Docker Desktop or Docker Engine installed and running when GitHub MCP or local workflow testing is used
- **Git:** Installed and available in PATH
- **Node.js:** Installed (required by some MCP servers)
- **Python:** Installed (optional, for some tools)

**Platform scripts:** `setup-windows.ps1`, `setup-macos.ps1`, and `setup-ubuntu.ps1`

### 3.2 Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `-Client` | Enum | No | `Both` | Target clients: `Both`, `ClaudeCode`, or `Codex` |
| `-IncludeFilesystem` | Switch | No | $false | Enable Filesystem MCP for project access |
| `-FilesystemPath` | String[] | Conditional | — | One or more roots for Filesystem MCP; required with `-IncludeFilesystem` |
| `-SkipGraphify` | Switch | No | $false | Skip Graphify and its `uv` prerequisite |
| `-SkipClaudeMem` | Switch | No | $false | Skip optional third-party `claude-mem` |
| `-SkipGitHub` | Switch | No | $false | Skip GitHub CLI and GitHub MCP setup |
| `-SkipPlaywright` | Switch | No | $false | Skip Playwright MCP registration |
| `-IncludeDatabase` | Switch | No | $false | Register a separately reviewed database MCP server |

### 3.3 Installation Components

The setup script installs and configures:

| Component | Purpose | Registration | Auto-run |
|-----------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Command-line prerequisites** | Node.js, selected clients, GitHub CLI, act, and uv | Platform package manager | Yes |
| **Graphify** | Repository knowledge graph indexing | Claude Code, Codex | Yes |
| **Claude Memory** | Persistent memory system (claude-mem) | Claude Code, Codex | Yes |
| **GitHub MCP** | GitHub API access via Docker | Claude Code, Codex | Yes |
| **Playwright MCP** | Browser automation | Claude Code, Codex | Yes |

## Container Architecture

`setup-llm/Dockerfile` is a multi-stage build. The build stage installs PowerShell, synchronizes `setup-llm/docs` into the pinned Docusaurus submodule, installs the locked frontend dependencies, and generates the static site. The runtime stage contains PowerShell, the setup source, nginx, and only the generated site output needed for documentation serving.

`setup-llm/entrypoint.ps1` is the PowerShell entry point and exposes three modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `docs` | Default; serves the prebuilt site through nginx on port 8080 |
| `setup` | Forwards remaining arguments to the cross-platform `setup-llm/scripts/setup.ps1` dispatcher |
| `pwsh` | Starts PowerShell for direct inspection or script execution |

Container setup is isolated from the host. `/root/.config` and `/workspace` are declared as persistence points. Docker-based MCP integrations require an explicit host socket mount, which grants the container control of the host Docker daemon.

The GitHub workflow validates the documentation and container independently. Pull requests produce a downloadable OCI archive without publishing it. On `main`, the workflow also authenticates with `GITHUB_TOKEN` and publishes SHA and `latest` image tags to GitHub Container Registry.
| **Filesystem MCP** | Local file system access | Claude Code, Codex | Conditional |

### 3.4 Output & Configuration

After successful execution:

- Command-line tools are verified and available in PATH
- MCP server configurations are written to:
  - **Claude Code:** `~/.anthropic/claude-code-config.json` (or equivalent)
  - **Codex:** Local MCP registrations
- Environment variables set in `.env`:
  - `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (read from `$EnvFile`)
  - `FILESYSTEM_ALLOWED_ROOT` (if Filesystem MCP enabled)

### 3.5 Post-Installation Steps

After running the setup script:

1. Restart Claude Code and Codex (or start new sessions) to load MCP registrations
2. Verify MCP tools are available: run `/mcp` in Codex or check MCP list in Claude Code
3. Confirm GitHub MCP is functional: Docker Desktop or Docker Engine must remain running

## 4. Phase 2: Project Creation

### 4.1 Project Initialization Steps

```powershell
# Step 1: Create project directory under Filesystem MCP allowed root
$projectPath = 'D:\Dropbox\Projects\MyProject'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $projectPath
Set-Location $projectPath

# Step 2: Initialize Git repository
git init

# Step 3: Create initial project structure
```

### 4.2 Required Project Structure

Every new project **must** contain:

```
ProjectRoot/
├── README.md                 # Project overview, setup, prerequisites, build/test/run
├── AGENTS.md                 # Repository guidance for Codex
├── CLAUDE.md                 # Repository guidance for Claude Code
├── .gitignore                # Ignore system files, build outputs, .env
├── .env.example              # Template for environment variables (do not commit secrets)
├── docs/
│   ├── architecture.md       # System architecture and design decisions
│   └── decisions/            # ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
├── src/                      # Source code
└── tests/                    # Test suite
```

### 4.3 Initial `.gitignore` Requirements

Minimum entries to prevent accidental commits:

```
# Environment & secrets
.env
.env.local
*.key
*.pem
secrets/

# IDE & build outputs
.vscode/
.idea/
node_modules/
dist/
build/
bin/
obj/

# System
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

### 4.4 Initial Git Commit

Only commit after initial scaffold builds and tests successfully:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project scaffold"
```

---

## 5. Phase 3: Project Instructions

Every project **must** define durable rules in version-controlled files. These are not automatically generated; they require intentional authorship.

### 5.1 `README.md` (Required)

**Purpose:** Human-readable project documentation

**Minimum sections:**

- **What this project does:** One-paragraph summary
- **Prerequisites:** Required languages, frameworks, tools, services
- **Local setup:** Step-by-step commands to get the project running locally
- **Configuration:** How to set environment variables, API keys, database connections
- **Build:** Exact command(s) to build the project
- **Test:** Exact command(s) to run the test suite
- **Run locally:** Exact command(s) to start the application
- **Architecture overview:** High-level diagram or description
- **Contributing:** Link to AGENTS.md or additional guidelines

**Template structure:**

```markdown
# Project Name

One-paragraph description of what the project does.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker Desktop
- GitHub CLI

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Copy .env.example to .env and configure
4. Run migrations: npm run migrate

## Build

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
\`\`\`

## Test

\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

## Run Locally

\`\`\`bash

\`\`\`

## Architecture

[Describe main components and data flow]

See `docs/architecture.md` in the generated project for detailed design decisions.
```

### 5.2 `CLAUDE.md` (Required for Claude Code Projects)

**Purpose:** Claude Code-specific repository instructions

**Audience:** Claude Code, Claude Desktop (Cowork mode)

**Structure:**

```markdown
# Claude Code Project Instructions

## Commands

- **Install:** [exact command]
- **Build:** [exact command]
- **Test:** [exact command]
- **Lint:** [exact command]
- **Run locally:** [exact command]

## Architecture Principles

- Keep domain logic independent from infrastructure
- Put external integrations behind interfaces
- Record consequential decisions in docs/decisions/

## Workflow

- Read relevant tests before changing behavior
- Make the smallest coherent change
- Run affected checks before committing
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or local .env files

## Tools & MCP Servers

Available tools:
- **Filesystem MCP:** Access project files
- **GitHub MCP:** Query GitHub issues, PRs, and actions
- **Playwright MCP:** Test browser behavior when needed

## Memory & Knowledge

- Keep architecture rationale in docs/ or ADRs
- Use /memory for conventions and lessons from prior work
- Memory supplements but does not replace versioned documentation

## First Time Setup

```
/init         # Generate initial instructions (review before committing)
/context      # Verify loaded instructions
/memory       # Inspect memory settings
/graphify .   # Index repository when it has sufficient source code
```
```

### 5.3 `AGENTS.md` (Required for Codex Projects)

**Purpose:** Codex-specific repository working agreement

**Audience:** Codex CLI, Codex Desktop

**Structure:**

```markdown
# Project Working Agreement

## Commands

- **Install:** [exact command]
- **Build:** [exact command]
- **Test:** [exact command]
- **Lint:** [exact command]
- **Run locally:** [exact command]

## Architecture

- Keep domain logic independent from infrastructure
- Put external integrations behind interfaces
- Record consequential architecture decisions in docs/decisions/

## Workflow

- Read relevant tests before changing behavior
- Make the smallest coherent change
- Run the checks affected by the change
- Never commit secrets, generated credentials, or local .env files

## MCP Tools Available

- **github:** Query and manage GitHub issues, PRs, and repositories
- **filesystem:** Access project files within configured root
- **playwright:** Browser automation for integration testing

## First Time Orientation

Use `/mcp` or `/mcp verbose` to confirm local MCP tools have loaded.

Ask me to:
1. Read AGENTS.md and README.md
2. Inspect the repository structure without editing
3. Explain architecture, build/test/run commands, current Git status
4. Identify the smallest useful next task
```

### 5.4 Nested `AGENTS.md` (Optional)

For large projects with distinct subsystems, create subdirectory-specific `AGENTS.md` files:

```
ProjectRoot/
├── AGENTS.md                    # Root project guidance
├── backend/
│   └── AGENTS.md                # Backend-specific rules
└── frontend/
    └── AGENTS.md                # Frontend-specific rules
```

## 6. First-Run Workflows

### 6.1 First Run: Claude Code

**Prerequisites:**
- Workstation setup complete
- Project created with structure from Section 4.2
- CLAUDE.md exists and is reviewed

**Steps:**

1. Open PowerShell in project root: `Set-Location 'D:\Dropbox\Projects\MyProject'`
2. Launch Claude Code: `claude`
3. Run `/init` if CLAUDE.md does not exist (generate and review before committing)
4. Run `/context` to confirm instructions loaded
5. Run `/memory` to inspect memory settings
6. Verify MCP tools: Check MCP list for `github`, `playwright`, `filesystem`
7. Run `/graphify .` if repository has sufficient source code

**Suggested initial prompt:**

```
Read CLAUDE.md, README.md, and the architecture notes.
Inspect the repository without editing.
Tell me:
- How to build, test, and run the project
- The main components and their relationships
- Missing setup documentation
- The smallest useful next implementation task
```

### 6.2 First Run: Codex

#### Codex CLI

1. Open PowerShell in project root: `Set-Location 'D:\Dropbox\Projects\MyProject'`
2. Launch Codex CLI: `codex`
3. Verify MCP tools: Run `/mcp` or `/mcp verbose`

#### Codex Desktop

1. Open project folder as task workspace
2. Create a new task; Codex auto-discovers `AGENTS.md`
3. Run `/mcp` or `/mcp verbose` to confirm MCP tools loaded

**Steps for both:**

1. Ask Codex to read `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`
2. Request repository orientation without editing
3. Explain the architecture and build/test/run commands
4. Identify the smallest useful next task

**Suggested initial prompt:**

```
Read AGENTS.md and README.md.
Inspect the repository and test setup without editing.
Explain the architecture, exact build/test/run commands, current Git status,
and the smallest useful next task.
Flag contradictions or missing instructions before proposing changes.
```

### 6.3 First Run: Claude Desktop (Cowork)

**Prerequisites:**
- Claude Desktop installed
- Project located under Filesystem MCP allowed root
- CLAUDE.md and README.md exist

**Steps:**

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Select **Cowork** mode
3. Create a new task
4. Explicitly grant folder access to `D:\Dropbox\Projects\MyProject`
5. Ask Claude to read `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and architecture notes first
6. Review folder access permissions before allowing edits

**Suggested initial prompt:**

```
Work only inside the connected MyProject folder.
Read README.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and docs/architecture.md.
Do not edit yet.
Explain how the project is built, tested, and run.
Identify missing documentation and the safest first task.
```

## 7. Validation & Verification

### 7.1 Workstation Setup Validation

After Phase 1 (`setup.ps1`):

```powershell
# Verify command-line tools
git --version
node --version
docker --version

# Verify MCP servers (in Claude Code or Codex)
/mcp                          # List all available MCP tools

# Test GitHub MCP (verify Docker is running)
# In Codex: /github get issue microsoft/vscode 12345
```

### 7.2 Project Setup Validation

After Phase 2 (project creation):

```powershell
# Verify project structure
ls -Recurse -Directory -Name | Select-Object -First 10

# Verify Git setup
git config user.name
git status

# Build and test
npm run build
npm test
```

### 7.3 Project Instructions Validation

After Phase 3 (first run):

```powershell
# Verify instructions loaded
# In Claude Code: /context
# In Codex: /mcp

# Verify all required commands work
npm install
npm run build
npm test
npm start

# Verify no secrets in Git
git log --all --pretty=format: --name-only | sort -u | grep -E '\.env|secrets|\.key|\.pem'
```

## 8. Troubleshooting Reference

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Setup script fails** | Prerequisites missing | Run the matching platform setup script and verify Docker Desktop or Docker Engine is running |
| **MCP tools not visible** | Client not restarted after setup | Restart Claude Code or Codex; start a new Codex session |
| **GitHub MCP fails** | Docker not running or token invalid | Ensure Docker Desktop or Docker Engine is running; verify `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env` |
| **Filesystem MCP cannot access project** | Project not under allowed root | Move project under `FilesystemPath` configured in setup or re-run setup with correct path |
| **Instructions not loading** | Wrong filename or wrong directory | Verify exact filenames (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) and client was opened at repository root |
| **Graph information stale** | Graphify cache outdated | Re-run `/graphify .` after moving files or major refactoring |
| **Secrets leaked to Git** | `.gitignore` not set before commit | Remove from tracked files and history; rotate secrets; verify `.gitignore` |

---

## 9. File Dependencies & References

### Input Files (Read by Users/Scripts)

- `.env` (from `FilesystemPath`) — Contains `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `.env.example` — Template for new projects

### Output Files (Created/Modified by Setup)
